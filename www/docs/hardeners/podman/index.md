# Podman hardener

Run `av harden podman` to apply this hardener and `av doctor podman` to verify it.

`av harden podman` keeps Red Hat's official Developer ID-signed, Hardened
Runtime client at `/opt/podman/bin/podman`. It migrates supported registry-level
credentials from Podman's macOS `auth.json`, installs Automic Vault's protected
Podman registry credential helper, and selects it through a user
`registries.conf.d` drop-in. Registry addresses remain as non-secret helper
markers so Podman's remote protocol can discover the credentials it must ask
Automic Vault to release.

Podman's macOS remote client resolves the credential locally before sending it
to the Linux service. Automic Vault verifies that live client, its complete
arguments, its registry, and its Launcher before releasing the credential.
Docker and Podman share registry credentials but use separate Authorization
Gates and exact helper launchers. Podman's upstream remote protocol sends all
configured registry credentials to its Linux service, so every credential read
is classified as a Secret Dump. Namespaced credentials and competing helpers
fail closed because the external helper protocol cannot preserve them safely.

Install Podman with the [official macOS installer] before hardening. An Isotope
is unnecessary while Red Hat ships an eligible signed client.
